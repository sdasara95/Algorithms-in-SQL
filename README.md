# Algorithms-in-SQL
Implementation of popular algorithms in SQL from scratch

The implementation was done in PostGres. <br>
The following algorithms have been implemented from scratch in SQL:
* Supersets of set
* Finding vertices in a graph that are connected by an even and odd length path
* Topological sort
* 3-colorable graph or not
* Hamiltonian cycle
* t-frequent set using Apriori rule
* Kmeans
* Finding aggregated weights of all the parts
* Dijkstra's algorithm 
* Map-reduce
